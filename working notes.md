### player states
- freemode
- hotlap

- race (active)

### race/hotlap mode

if a player DNFs a race, they can do whatever, even hotlap in between, and still safely rejoin the race

track can be loaded and unloaded client-side whenever, but only 1 track can be loaded at a time

a race is basically a synchronized hotlap between multiple people for a specific amount of time (or laps)

### TODO 2026-01-01:

- block wanted stars
- block district/car/money texts
- speedometer
- weather selection
- pre-configured time-of-day selection
